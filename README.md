# avl-tree4.0
This repository contains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an actual working implementation of an AVL-tree written in C++;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sample program for testing out its functionality.<br />
<br />
Detailed descriptions of this data structure and its methods will hopefully appear later in the sample program.
In addition theory for backing up why this implementation works (is supposed to work) would be greatly appreciated(by no one :-D ).
